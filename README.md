# Ransomware

<h5><p>A python Ransomware made for educational purpose to learn about ransomware and how it works. It shows how a basic ransomware works
  
  and encrypt files by palying a simple python and  in background it encrypt all files without the user knwoledge.So for encrypted files we need
  
  to decrypt them so also included a decryption python script to decrypt the encrypted files by entering the secret key in a text file called
  
  secret.txt When running the decrypt script you need to enter the decrypt key that in secret.txt file so no need to worry of using this script
  
  and A Warining you should not run the python script from the out of Ransomware directory . If you run the out of the directory all may be encrypted
  
  and that will be your responsiblity so dont run the script from out of the directory. Learn and run enjoy!</p></h5>
